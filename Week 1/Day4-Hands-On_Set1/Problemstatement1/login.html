      Responsive web design (RWD) is a web design approach to make web pages
      render well on all screen sizes and resolutions while ensuring good
      usability. It is the way to design for a multi-device web. In this
      article, we'll help you understand some techniques that can be used to
      master it.

      Mobile devices used to be low-powered in terms of CPU/GPU and available
      bandwidth. Some didn't support CSS or even HTML, and as a result, it was
      common to perform server-side browser sniffing to determine device/browser
      type before then serving a site that the device would be able to cope
      with. Mobile devices often had really simple, basic experiences served to
      them because it was all they could handle. These days, mobile devices are
      able to handle the same technologies as desktop computers, so such
      techniques are less common.
